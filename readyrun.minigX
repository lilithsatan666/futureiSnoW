It looks like the required branch n-10 does not exist in https://github.com/lilithsatan666/react-leaflet-draw, so I couldn't add the key.mod file.

Would you like me to create the n-10 branch for you first and then add the files?
Or do you want the files added to a different branch, such as main?

Let me know which option you prefer or provide further instructions.

I don't have permission to create or update files directly in sirensolutions/react-leaflet-draw.

You can do this manually:

Create a branch named n-10 from the main branch.
Add the following files at the repository root (use these placeholder contents, or customize as needed):
key.mod
Code
# key.mod placeholder
identify.include
Code
// identify.include placeholder
root
Code
#!/usr/bin/env bash
echo "root placeholder"
look.bin.mm
Code
// look.bin.mm placeholder
Optionally, run:

Code
chmod +x root
chmod +x look.bin.mm
to make those files executable.

Commit with the message:

Code
Add key.mod identify.include root look.bin.mm
and push the n-10 branch.

Open a pull request from n-10 into your default branch.

If you want instructions for another repo or the GitHub web UI, just ask!

The branch n-10 does not exist in lilithsatan666/futureiSnoW, so I was unable to add the key.mod file.

If you want to proceed, please create the n-10 branch in your repository (either via GitHub web UI or command line).
Then, let me know and I can add the files as requested, or guide you on how to do it step by step.

Would you like instructions for creating the branch and adding files manually, or do you want me to continue once the branch exists?

update me on the new network api.asp.net protocol added to mthe initial.256 script sphimx <htm.sh
GitHub Copilot Chat Assistant.

I don’t yet have enough info to find or summarize that change. Quick clarifying questions before I search or give details:

Which repository (or repositories) should I inspect? (You previously listed several; which one contains the initial.256 / htm.sh script?)
Do you want:
a) Where the string "api.asp.net" appears in code, or
b) Which commit/PR added the new "network api.asp.net protocol" and a summary of that change, or
c) Both code locations and the commit/PR history?
Exact filenames/paths if you know them (initial.256, sphimx, htm.sh, etc.), and the branch to check (default: main/master).
If you want to run the checks locally or I should provide exact commands, here are fast ways to find and review the change yourself (pick whichever fits):

Search across all your repos (web):

Code search for your user: https://github.com/search?q=user%3Alilithsatan666+api.asp.net&type=code
Search inside a single repo (web):

repo:lilithsatan666/<repo> example: https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Alilithsatan666%2FfutureiSnoW+api.asp.net&type=code
Using git locally (recommended when you have the repo cloned):

Clone the repo (if not already): git clone git@github.com:lilithsatan666/<repo

degress.os
Do you mean a file named "degress.os", or something else? Tell me which of these you want and any details:

Search for occurrences of "degress.os" (in all your repos or a specific repo).
Add/create a file named degress.os (which repo(s)? path? exact contents?).
Explain what "degress.os" should contain / be used for (give intent and I can suggest content).
Update an existing degress.os file with new content (provide path and new contents).
If you want me to act (create/update/search), confirm:

Target repo(s) (default: lilithsatan666/react-leaflet-draw since you linked it).
Branch name to use (default: n-10 or a branch you choose).
File contents (paste them) or say “placeholder” and I’ll use a short template.
Make executable? (yes/no)
Or, if you just want commands to run locally or links to search on GitHub, say “commands” and I’ll provide them. Which do you want?

re-run  last file network key
Do you mean “re-run” the previous attempt to add the network/key files (key.mod, identify.include, root, look.bin.mm) on the target repos? I can either (A) try the GitHub API again (may fail if the integration lacks permission) or (B) give a ready-to-run script/commands you can run locally (recommended, since you are the repo owner).

Please confirm these quick details so I do the right thing:

Target repositories (confirm one or all):
lilithsatan666/react-leaflet-draw
lilithsatan666/cryptoMoneYiSPhUN4mYGiirlzz
lilithsatan666/futureiSnoW
lilithsatan666/ReconFS
lilithsatan666/satan3O_vBetax
sirensolutions/react-leaflet-draw
Branch name to create: n-10 (confirm or change)
File contents (I’ll use these placeholders unless you provide different text):
key.mod
key.mod placeholder
identify.include // identify.include placeholder
root #!/usr/bin/env bash echo "root placeholder"
look.bin.mm // look.bin.mm placeholder
Make executable: yes for root and look.bin.mm (confirm)
Open pull requests from n-10 → default branch, or push directly? (PR recommended)
If that matches what you want, run the following script locally (it will create branch n-10, add the files, make two executable, commit, push, and open a PR using GitHub CLI). Prereqs: git and gh (GitHub CLI) installed and authenticated as you.

Save and run (adjust REPOS array if you want different repos):

#!/usr/bin/env bash set -euo pipefail

REPOS=( "lilithsatan666/react-leaflet-draw" "lilithsatan666/cryptoMoneYiSPhUN4mYGiirlzz" "lilithsatan666/futureiSnoW" "lilithsatan666/ReconFS" "lilithsatan666/satan3O_vBetax" "sirensolutions/react-leaflet-draw" )

create PR (will open interactive editor if necessary; use --body to skip)
gh pr create --fill --base main || gh pr create --fill --base master || echo "Create PR manually for $owner_repo"

cd "$TMPDIR" done

echo "Done. Temp dir: $TMPDIR"

Notes:

The script tries main then master as base when creating PRs. If your default branch is different, change --base.
If a repository already has branch n-10, git checkout -b will fail; the script tries to create it; you can remove existing branch or choose another name.
If you prefer not to open PRs automatically, remove the gh pr create line.
If you do not have gh installed, use the git commands in the loop and create PRs via the web UI.
If you want, I can:

Attempt these changes via the GitHub API now (I’ll try, but I will likely hit permission errors like before). Reply “API” to have me attempt it.
Or adjust file contents or target repos before you run the script — reply with edits.
Which do you want me to do next?

yes just the ready run file plz :)
